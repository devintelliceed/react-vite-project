    <p>In the ancient city of Uruk, nestled along the banks of the mighty Euphrates River, there lived a scribe named
        Elam. Uruk was a bustling metropolis, one of the greatest cities of ancient Mesopotamia, filled with merchants,
        artisans, and scholars. Elam was renowned for his meticulous record-keeping and keen intellect, but he too
        struggled with the daily demands of his life and work.</p>
    <p><br/>One particularly hectic summer, Elam found himself overwhelmed by the sheer volume of tasks he had to
        manage. The king needed detailed records of the grain stores, the temple priests required an inventory of their
        sacred offerings, and countless merchants sought his help in documenting their trades. Elam’s clay tablet
        collection was vast, yet he constantly lost track of which tasks were most urgent.</p>

    <p><br/>One sweltering afternoon, as he sat in the shade of a grand ziggurat, inspiration struck. Elam took a smooth
        clay tablet and a reed stylus and began to inscribe a list of all his pending tasks. He drew a series of
        vertical lines, creating neat columns. At the top of each column, he etched symbols representing different
        categories: one for royal duties, another for temple responsibilities, and a third for personal errands.</p>
    <p><br/>Under each category, Elam listed specific tasks using concise cuneiform script. As he completed each task,
        he would simply draw a horizontal line through it, signifying its completion. This method brought a sense of
        order and clarity to his otherwise chaotic life.</p>
    <p><br/>Elam’s colleagues noticed his newfound efficiency and began to adopt his method. They marveled at how a
        simple tablet of tasks could transform their productivity. Word of this innovation spread quickly through Uruk
        and eventually reached the king himself.</p>
    <img src={thirdImage} alt='list on rock' className="float-left size-48 m-2"/>
    <p><br/>King Gilgamesh, intrigued by the idea, summoned Elam to his palace. {'Show me this method of yours,'} the
        king commanded. Elam presented his clay tablet, explaining how it helped him manage his numerous
        responsibilities. Impressed, Gilgamesh decreed that all scribes in his court should use this system to maintain
        order and efficiency.</p>
    <p><br/>As the use of task lists spread throughout the city, Uruk became even more prosperous. Merchants kept better
        track of their goods, temple priests managed their rituals with greater precision, and the king’s administrators
        became models of organization.</p>
    <p><br/>Elams simple yet effective invention was inscribed on tablets and stored in the great library of Uruk,
        ensuring that future generations could benefit from his insight. Over time, the practice of creating To-Do lists
        spread across Mesopotamia and beyond, carried by traders and scholars to distant lands.</p>

    <p><br/>Centuries passed, and while the format and materials evolved—from clay tablets to papyrus scrolls, and
        eventually to parchment and paper—the fundamental concept remained the same. The To-Do list became an enduring
        legacy, a testament to the ingenuity of an ancient scribe seeking to bring order to his world.</p>
    <p><br/>Thus, from the ancient city of Uruk, the humble To-Do list journeyed through time, helping countless
        generations to manage their lives more effectively, and proving that even in the ancient world, the simplest
        ideas could leave a lasting impact.</p>
